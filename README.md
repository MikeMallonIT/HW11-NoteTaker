# Homework 11 - Note Taker - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week I used express to host a virtual server on my computer. The application that I built will allow users to add, remove and retrieve notes that are saved in a database. 


<br>

### Motivation:
This application marked the first truly server-side application that I have worked with so far. Very rarely will we write applications that use the client's resources (all previous apps) but that knowledge was needed to get to this point. All future projects will build on this concept


<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Built server.js file
    * Built routes files for database and HTML
    * Added GET, POST and DELETE functions
    * Used HEROKU to host the Express server

<br />
<br />

## Installation:
Download all associated files in this repository. Install Node.js then use the `npm install` function. After that, CD to the directory the root application folder is installed in and use the `node index.js` function.
