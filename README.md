# Homework 11 - Note Taker - Michael Mallon

## What I did

This week I used express to host a virtual server on my computer. The application that I built will allow users to add, remove and retrieve notes that are saved in a database. 


<br>

### Motivation:
This application marked the first truly server-side application that I have worked with so far. Very rarely will we write applications that use the client's resources (all previous apps) but that knowledge was needed to get to this point. All future projects will build on this concept



<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Built server.js file
    * Built routes files for database and HTML
    * Added GET, POST and DELETE functions
    * Used HEROKU to host the Express server

<br />
<br />

## Installation:
You are welcome to download this repository locally to your workstation and host is there or use the deployed link on [HEROKU](https://mm-hw11-notetaker.herokuapp.com/) 

To install:
1. Clone the [HW11-NoteTaker](https://github.com/MikeMallonIT/HW11-NoteTaker) repository
2. In termainal or command prompt, navigate to the folder where you have cloned the repository
3. Ensure you are working in the same directory as the server.js file
4. Type `npm install` into the cli (termainal or command prompt)
5. Type `nmp start` into the cli
6. The cli should then show `Listening on PORT: http://localhost:8080`
7. Copy `http://localhost:8080` from cli and paste into your webbrowser
8. The note taker will now work!
